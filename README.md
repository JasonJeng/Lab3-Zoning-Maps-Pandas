# Creating Zoning Maps Using Python & Pandas
By following this tutorial, you’ll learn to navigate geographic shapefiles in a Jupyter Notebook (we'll be using Colab). You will upload data from DC’s open data portal, and then concatenate datasets and conduct some basic analysis. Finally, you'll create a basic map, and create a new `.shp` file that can be used with ESRI products... or can be uploaded to a service like [Carto](https://www.carto.com/) to create the online map you see below! Check out a live version of [my final map here](https://shadrock.carto.com/builder/df4c5d9f-1c1e-4df4-bb15-42681ba14aac/embed?state=%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22ne%22%3A%5B38.838460360929645%2C-77.21660658717157%5D%2C%22sw%22%3A%5B39.03127554305828%2C-76.8502812087536%5D%2C%22center%22%3A%5B38.93493348047009%2C-77.03344389796258%5D%2C%22zoom%22%3A12%7D%7D).

In this lab, students are required to create a shapefile (.shp) showing the zoning-exempted buildings that provide affordable housing in the D.C. region by using Google Colab. Students should acquire the Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) information (including shapefiles and spreadsheets) as input from OpenData D.C. as of 05/04/2021, and a crosswalk table that shows equivalent elements (or "attributes") in more than one database schema. Students will learn and be able to use functions from two powerful python libraries, pandas and geopandas, and upload and create outputs on Google Drive. Finally, students will use CARTO, an online mapping webpage, to display the final output map. Below is a screenshot of the final map, and a link to the final online map is provided in this repository.

This tutorial was originally created by [Nicole Janeway Bills](https://twitter.com/nicole_janeway), who provides a nice [video walkthrough on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9G2T4CPYVM&feature=emb_logo). I've changed some of the code slightly to deal with different inputs (Open Data D.C.'s file formatting has changed since the original tutorial); added more background context on the scenario, and added the use of Carto for a final output.
